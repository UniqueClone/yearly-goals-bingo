## What is it?

This is a tool to help you generate a PDF of your goals for the
year 2025. You can use this to help you visualize your goals and
make them more real.

New Year's resolutions are often forgotten by the end of
January, and often because they are unrealistic and people set
an unrealistic number of goals. This tool is designed to help
you choose goals with a higher chance of success.{" "}

You do not aim to complete all of your goals, but rather to
complete a bingo line of goals. Good luck!

## How do I use it?

Go to the live site at <https://goals-bingo.vercel.app/> and fill in the
form. The form consists of a field for your name, 24 fields for your goals
(`Free Square!` is automatically used for the center square), and a final button to
generate the PDF.

Your goals will be randomly shuffled and placed on a bingo card. You can then
print the PDF and hang it on your wall or save it for later.
